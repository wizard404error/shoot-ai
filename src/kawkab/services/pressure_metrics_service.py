"""Pressure metrics service - compute pressing and defensive pressure analytics.

Computes professional-grade pressure metrics:
- PPDA (Passes Per Defensive Action) by zone
- Pressing traps (forcing play into specific zones)
- Passes under pressure (%)
- Pressure events (defender within 2m of ball carrier)
- Counter-press success rate
- Time to regain possession after loss
- Defensive line height and compactness
- Pressure intensity by period (first 15 min, last 15 min, etc.)

These metrics are used by tactical analysts to evaluate pressing systems
and defensive organization.
