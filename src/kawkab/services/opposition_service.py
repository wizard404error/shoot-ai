"""Opposition intelligence service (Phase D).

Wires the previously dead ``OpponentDossier`` analysis module through
real stored data, adds the set-play library, and provides vendor-data
import probing with an explicit honest no-provider state.

Honesty contract:

- The dossier is computed over the club's own stored opponent matches
  and events. Fewer than the dossier's meaningful sample is labeled
  ``small_sample`` with the count; an opponent with no stored matches
  returns ``no_data``, never a template report.
- What the raw event store cannot support is reported as unknown, not
  approximated: pressing intensity (PPDA) and build-up style need
  tracking/breakpoint data this repo does not produce, so the dossier
  shows the engine's ``unknown``; the predicted lineup needs linked
  player minutes, so it stays at the engine's fallback.
- Vendor imports (kloppy-supported providers: StatsBomb, Opta,
  SkillCorner, Second Spectrum...) are probed at runtime. kloppy is
  declared in pyproject but optional: if the import fails, the state is
  ``provider_available: false`` with a reason — same honesty as the
  Transfermarkt precedent. No synthetic vendor data is ever produced.
- The scoreline ``prediction`` inside the dossier is a naive historical
  average, surfaced with a provenance note — it is not a model forecast.
