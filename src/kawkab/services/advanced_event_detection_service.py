"""Advanced event detection service - extends basic pass/shot detection.

Derives 15+ event types from tracking data without requiring additional CV models:
- Dribbles: ball carrier moves with ball for N+ frames
- Tackles: defender wins ball from attacker with close proximity
- Interceptions: defender cuts off pass without attacker touching ball
- Clearances: ball kicked from defensive third to safety with high speed
- Crosses: pass from wide area into penalty area
- Ball recoveries: team wins possession back
- Blocks: defender stops shot/pass near own goal
- Duels: two players contest ball within 2m
- Carries: ball moves with player (no pass, no dribble)
- Progressive actions: ball advances >10m toward opponent goal
- Passes into final third / penalty area
- High turnovers: ball lost in final 40m
- Defensive actions: tackle + interception + clearance + block
- Set pieces: ball near corner flag, free kick positions

Uses the existing FrameDetections data from CVService.
