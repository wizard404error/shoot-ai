"""Football Rules Service - encodes IFAB Laws of the Game.

Provides:
- 17 Laws of the Game as structured YAML
- Event classification (foul → free kick / penalty / yellow card)
- Offside detection
- Restart type lookup
- Human-readable law summaries

The Laws of the Game are maintained by IFAB (International Football Association
