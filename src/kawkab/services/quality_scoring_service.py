"""Quality scoring service - compute per-match data quality scores.

Provides a comprehensive quality score for each match analysis:
1. Tracking quality (0-1) - how well did BoT-SORT track players
2. Event detection quality (0-1) - how reliable are the detected events
3. Homography quality (0-1) - how good is the pitch calibration
4. Team assignment quality (0-1) - how confident is the team color clustering
5. Overall quality (0-1) - weighted composite of all factors

Stores scores in the database for historical tracking and improvement.
