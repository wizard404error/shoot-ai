"""LLM groundedness gate (transformation Phase D / D4).

The trust layer's second half: any LLM-surfaced claim must cite its
evidence. This service does two things:

1. **Evidence registry** — ``register_match_evidence`` distills a
   match's *stored* events and player attributions into a durable
   evidence record (kind ``event_summary``) whose payload is the
   complete set of checkable facts (counts, scorers, cards, shots).
   Nothing is inferred here: only quantities directly read from the
   event store.

2. **Claim gate** — ``gate_claims`` checks a review text sentence by
   sentence against the evidence corpus:

   - every *number* in a sentence must appear verbatim in the corpus,
     otherwise the sentence is flagged (numbers are the most
     confident-looking lies);
   - content words must overlap the corpus above a threshold, else the
     sentence is ``unsupported`` (a claim about nothing observable);
   - the overall verdict is ``grounded`` / ``partly_grounded`` /
     ``ungrounded`` — a review goes out with its grounding report
     attached, never silently.

Deliberately narrow: this is a lexical gate against fabrication, not
a semantic fact-checker. Its provenance block says exactly that.
