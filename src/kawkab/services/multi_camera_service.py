"""Multi-camera fusion — merges tracks from N calibrated cameras into a shared 3D pitch space.

Architecture:
- Each camera has its own homography H (pixel → pitch)
- Each camera produces independent track IDs
- The fusion service maps all tracks to shared pitch coordinates
- Identity matching across cameras uses: pitch position proximity + appearance ReID + temporal consistency
- Output: unified track list with global IDs projected onto the canonical pitch

Professional use case:
- 2-8 camera setup around the pitch
- Each camera covers 1/4 to 1/2 of the pitch (partial overlap)
- Fusion enables: full-pitch tracking, occlusion handling, multi-angle event review
