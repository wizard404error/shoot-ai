"""Player physical metrics from tracking data.

Computes per-player:
  - Total distance run (m)
  - Average speed (km/h), max speed (km/h)
  - Sprint count (> 25 km/h), sprint distance
  - High intensity runs (> 20 km/h)
  - Jog/walk/sprint time breakdown
  - Distance per half

Requires homography-calibrated track positions (pixel → meter).
