"""Possession analysis service with proper tackle/loss attribution.

Standard possession stats just measure ball proximity which is unreliable
when players are close to each other. This service uses:
- Ball-tracking ownership with hysteresis
- Event-based verification (passes, touches, interceptions)
- Tackle detection (proximity + direction + outcome)
- Aerial duel attribution
- Counter-press detection (possession regained within 5s of loss)

Outputs per-team possession with confidence + per-player touches.
