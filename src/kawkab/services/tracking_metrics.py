"""Tracking self-consistency metrics using py-motmetrics.

Computes MOT-style metrics without ground truth by measuring:
- Track fragmentation (num_fragmentations)
- Identity switches (num_switches) — detected via spatial leaps
- Mostly tracked / mostly lost ratio
- Track coverage consistency

All metrics are intrinsic — they don't require GT annotations.
