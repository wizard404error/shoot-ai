"""Post-Shot Expected Goals (PSxG) — goalkeeper save probability.

PSxG measures the probability a shot on target is saved, based on
shot placement relative to the goal frame, shot speed, and angle.
This enables goalkeeper performance evaluation (goals conceded vs PSxG).

Uses a logistic regression model calibrated to public shot data.
