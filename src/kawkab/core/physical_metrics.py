"""Physical performance metrics from tracking data.

Computes professional-grade physical metrics:
- Distance covered (total, per minute, by speed zone)
- Sprint count and distance
- High-intensity runs (>5.5 m/s = 20 km/h)
- Acceleration/deceleration counts
- Metabolic power (estimated from instantaneous speed)
- Player load (accelerometer-derived workload estimate)

All numpy-only, no external dependencies beyond numpy.
