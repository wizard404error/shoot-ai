"""Database migration system for Kawkab AI.

Simple numbered migration system. Migrations are SQL scripts that upgrade
the schema from one version to the next. On startup, StorageService checks
the current schema_version and applies any pending migrations.

Migration files: src/kawkab/migrations/001_initial.sql, 002_add_seasons.sql, etc.

    """Split a SQL script into individual statements, comment- and
    string-literal-aware.

    A naive ``sql.split(";")`` corrupts any script containing a semicolon
    inside a ``--`` line comment, a ``/* ... */`` block comment, or a
    string literal ('it''s; here' with SQLite's doubled-quote escaping):
    the semicolon chops one real statement into two broken ones. This
    scanner treats those regions as opaque, so a ``;`` there never splits.
    Postgres dollar-quoted bodies (``$$ ... $$``, e.g. trigger functions)
    are also treated as opaque, which is what lets a function body full of
    semicolons survive as ONE statement.

    Scope note: this is NOT a full SQLite parser. ``CREATE TRIGGER ...
    BEGIN ... END;`` bodies still contain bare semicolons and are not
    supported (no migration file in this project uses one -- if that
    changes, this function needs to grow trigger-body awareness).

        Each migration file runs inside one explicit transaction, so a

        that file instead of leaving the schema partially changed with no
        way forward. Previously this used conn.executescript(sql) with no
        transaction at all: sqlite3.Connection.executescript() issues an
        implicit COMMIT before running and then autocommits each
        statement in the script as it executes, so it can't be made
        atomic just by wrapping it in BEGIN/COMMIT -- the implicit COMMIT
        would silently swallow that. If migration N failed at, say,
        statement 5 of 9: statements 1-4 were permanently applied,
        _set_version() never ran (it came after the failure), so the next
        startup saw version N-1 and re-applied migration N from statement
        1 -- which then failed immediately re-running a CREATE TABLE/ALTER
        TABLE that had already succeeded. The app was permanently bricked
