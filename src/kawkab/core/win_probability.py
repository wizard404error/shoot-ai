"""Win probability model — xG Monte Carlo simulation.

Uses Poisson-sampled xG simulation to compute minute-by-minute
win/draw/loss probabilities. Each goal event triggers a re-simulation
with remaining time and remaining xG.

This replaces the legacy Elo-based model with a proper simulation approach.
