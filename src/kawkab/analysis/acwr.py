"""Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) computation.

ACWR measures whether a player's current training load (acute, 7-day
rolling) relative to their chronic baseline (28-day rolling) is in a
safe zone. Based on Gabbett (2016): "The training-injury prevention
paradox: should athletes be training smarter and harder?"

Ranges (Gabbett 2016):
  - < 0.8:   Low / Under-training (may be deconditioned)
  - 0.8-1.3: Sweet spot (safe)
  - 1.3-1.5: High (increased risk)
  - > 1.5:   Very high (danger zone)

The acute load is the exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) of
daily loads (decay k=3, the standard "acute" time constant); chronic
load is the EWMA with k=7, which approximates a 28-day rolling baseline.
EWMA (Williams et al. 2017, "How to use acute:chronic workload ratios to
manage training load") reacts to load spikes faster than the
same-length rolling averages it replaced: a rolling 7-day average can
miss a mid-week spike entirely, while EWMA weights recent days heavier.

Caveat surfaced for consumers: for roughly the first 28 days both
averages are still warming up, and ratios computed from them are not
yet a trustworthy chronic baseline. Each row therefore carries a
`reliable` flag that turns on after 28 days of data.

Player load metric options:
  - total_distance_m (most common)
  - player_load (accelerometer-derived, Catapult PL units)
  - high_intensity_distance_m (sprint / HI running)
  - sRPE (session Rating of Perceived Exertion) — requires manual input
  - custom_weighted (combination)
