### ✅ **Option A — Production Quality Bar (v0.11.0–v0.12.0)**

- **A1: Profiler wired into analysis pipeline** — `profiler.begin/end` around enhancement, CV detection, analysis, save, and advanced metrics stages. frontend profiler panel with stage breakdown and bottleneck detection
- **A2: Prometheus-style observability** — `core/observability.py` with Counter, Gauge, Histogram primitives, Prometheus exposition format render, JSON export, singleton `metrics` object, `metrics_text` bridge slot
- **A3: .po-based i18n** — `locales/en.po` + `locales/ar.po` (77 keys each), `scripts/compile_i18n.py` → `.json`, JS frontend loads via `fetch()` with hardcoded fallback
- **A4: Coverage threshold 50%** — CI now `fail-under=50`, badge row in README
- **A5: E2E test scaffold** — `tests/e2e/test_e2e_pipeline.py` with 18 tests covering observability, profiler, bridge slots (AST-based), .po compilation, CI config

### ✅ **Option B — Extend (v0.12.0)**

---

## What's New in v0.8.3

### ✅ **Data Quality Fixes**

- **"Shot by unknown" team attribution fixed**: Shot events now fall back to `track_id % 2` parity-based assignment when `player_teams` is empty or returns "unknown" (same fallback that passes/possession/formations already use). Previously shots had no parity fallback.
- **xT (expected threat) now working**: Pass events now include `start_x_pct`, `start_y_pct`, `end_x_pct`, `end_y_pct` metadata, so `compute_xt_simple()` computes non-zero threat values. Before: metadata was empty → xT always 0.

- **New database table**: `benchmark_results` with per-stage timing, resource metrics, and system info
- **Migration 003**: `003_add_benchmark_table.sql`

---

## What's New in v0.6.4

### ✅ **ModelManager - Lazy Loading Foundation**

- **New `model_manager.py`** in `kawkab.core`:
  - `ensure_model(model_name)` — checks cache, downloads if missing, returns local path

### ✅ **Application Wiring**

- `app.py` now instantiates and passes `AdvancedEventDetectionService`, `PhysicalLoadService`, and `PressureMetricsService` to the Bridge
- All 19 services are now live in the application

---

## What's New in v0.6.2

### ✅ **Advanced Metrics Wired into Analysis Pipeline**

- **Three new services now integrated into `Bridge.analyze_match()`**:
  1. `AdvancedEventDetectionService` — detects dribbles, tackles, interceptions, clearances, crosses, ball recoveries, blocks, duels, carries, progressive actions, final third entries, high turnovers
  2. `PhysicalLoadService` — computes sprint counts, sprint distances, high-intensity distances, acceleration/deceleration counts per player
  3. `PressureMetricsService` — computes PPDA, passes under pressure %, pressure events, counter-press success rate, defensive line height per team
- **Progress reporting**: Analysis pipeline now reports at 0.88 (advanced metrics computation)
- **Database storage**: All advanced metrics stored in `advanced_metrics` table with proper categories (`physical`, `pressure`, `event`)
- **JSON response**: Results included in `analyze_match` response under `advanced_metrics.physical_load` and `advanced_metrics.pressure`
- **Graceful degradation**: If services are unavailable, analysis continues with empty advanced metrics (no crash)
- **StorageService**: New `save_advanced_metrics()` method for structured metric persistence

### ✅ **Tests**

- **2 new integration tests** for Bridge advanced metrics wiring:
  - `test_bridge_advanced_metrics_wiring`: Verifies services are called, results stored, and returned in JSON

  - `validate_jersey_number()`: Ensures 0-99 range
  - `sanitize_string()`: Removes control chars, null bytes, XSS vectors (`<`, `>`), truncates to max length
  - `validate_team_name()` / `validate_season_name()`: Non-empty, sanitized strings
- **All Bridge methods now validate inputs** before processing:
  - `save_match`, `analyze_match`, `export_match_csv`, `export_match_json`
  - `create_player_profile`, `compare_matches`, `get_match_quality_report`
  - `get_match_events`, `get_video_path`, `generate_report`, `save_homography`, `get_homography`, `get_first_frame`

- **14 new tests** for security validation (all pass)
- **Total tests: 50** (was 36)

### ✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**

- All database queries already use parameterized queries (StorageService)
- `MigrationManager` uses `executescript()` only for trusted, version-controlled `.sql` files
- No user input ever concatenated into SQL strings

### ✅ **Error Recovery**

- Bridge methods catch all exceptions and return sanitized JSON errors to frontend
- No unhandled exceptions leak internal paths or stack traces to users

---

## What's New in v0.6.0

### ✅ **Match Type Detection**

- CVService now infers `match_type` from video characteristics:
  - `full_match`: duration ≥ 80 min OR (duration ≥ 60 min + fragmentation < 2.0 + avg track span ≥ 60s)
  - `highlight`: duration < 20 min OR fragmentation ≥ 3.0 OR avg track span < 15s
  - `unknown`: everything in between
- `match_type` is stored in `MatchTrackData` and passed through the pipeline
- Enables context-aware analysis decisions (e.g., Kalman for full matches only)

### ✅ **Kalman Smoother Wired into Pipeline**

- v0.5.3 Kalman smoother was NOT connected — now it is
- Activated automatically when `match_type == "full_match"` AND `homography_matrix` is available
- Produces smoother trajectories for distance/speed computation on continuous 90-min footage
- Falls back to raw delta-cap approach for highlights (where Kalman degrades due to fragmentation)
- New `_compute_player_stats_kalman()` method in AnalysisService
- `use_kalman` toggle on `AnalysisService` (default: True)

### ✅ **Homography Bridge Fix**

- Bridge now loads and passes `homography_matrix` to `AnalysisService.analyze_match()`
- Before: analysis was always in pixel space, even after calibration
- After: meter-based stats are computed when calibration exists
- Enables: real meters for distance, formations, line height, xG, xT, and Kalman smoothing

### ✅ **Knowledge Base Expansion**

- **10 new tactical rules:**
  - Defensive: poor_pressing_shape, weak_aerial_defense, zonal_marking_gaps, defensive_third_errors
  - Transitions: slow_defensive_transition, poor_counter_pressing
  - Individual: midfielder_positioning, striker_pressing, winger_defensive_work_rate
  - Meta: goalkeeper_communication
- **5 new drills:**
  - pressing_shape_8v8, defensive_transition_6v6, aerial_defense_circles, zonal_marking_game, counter_pressing_4v4
- Total: **40 rules** (was 30), **24 drills** (was 19)
- All validated: load without errors, have EN+AR text, reference valid drills

### ✅ **Tests & Bug Fixes**

- 6 new tests for match_type detection and Kalman integration
- Fixed duplicate `get_drill()` method in KnowledgeService
- Fixed duplicate variable declarations in `AnalysisService._compute_player_stats()`
- All 32 unit tests pass

### ✅ **Professional Services Suite (NEW)**

- **6 new services** for professional-grade analytics:
  1. `PlayerProfileService` — Persistent player identity across matches (jersey, photo, position, physical attributes, career stats)
  2. `MultiMatchAnalysisService` — Season aggregation, player trends, match comparison, team evolution, leaderboards
  3. `DataExportService` — CSV, JSON, and StatsBomb-compatible event data export
  4. `VisualizationService` — Heatmaps, pass networks, pass sonars, formation diagrams (PNG output)
  5. `AnomalyDetectionService` — Detects impossible stats, tracking issues, missing data, statistical outliers
  6. `QualityScoringService` — Per-match quality scores (tracking, events, homography, team assignment) with weighted composite
- **Database migration system** — Versioned schema upgrades via `MigrationManager`
- **New tables**: seasons, player_profiles, player_match_links, advanced_metrics, match_comparisons, analysis_quality, exports
- **Bridge methods** — `export_match_csv`, `export_match_json`, `create_player_profile`, `get_all_player_profiles`, `compare_matches`, `get_match_quality_report`

## What v0.5.0 / v0.5.1 Fixed (incremental from v0.4.1)

### ✅ **Frame Skipping (v0.5.0)**

- New `frame_skip` parameter on `CVService.process_video()`
- Skips YOLO+BoT-SORT on every Nth frame
- Carries last detections forward for skipped frames
- **Test result**: 0.3x → 0.5x realtime on RTX 4070
- **Tunable**: frame_skip=1 (full), 2 (default), 3+ for big speedups

### ✅ **Real Team Color Assignment (v0.5.0)**

- v0.4.1 used `track_id % 2` (random — BoT-SORT IDs are sequential)
- v0.5.0 collects color samples during main processing
- k-means clusters players by jersey color
- Larger cluster = home (heuristic)
- **Test result**: 28 tracks → 16 home / 12 away (16 players = 11 + 5 subs, broadcast reality)
- All analysis functions updated to use `track_data.player_teams`

### ✅ **Formation Detection Now Works (v0.5.0)**

- Root cause: lifetime filter (`15% of total_frames`) was too strict
- Broadcast highlight cuts fragment tracks to 20-30s spans
- New filter: `min_span = 5% of duration` (works for fragmented tracks)
- **Test result**: formations 3-3-2 / 3-2-2 with line heights 27.25m / 46.33m

### ✅ **Speed Sanity Cap (v0.5.1)**

- Test showed max speeds of 400+ km/h (obviously wrong)
- Two bugs:
  1. `dt` was 0.02s (source fps) not 0.04s (effective with frame_skip=2)
  2. Per-frame delta was uncapped (broadcast cuts caused 4m teleports)
- Fix: 0.4m cap, correct dt from real frame timestamps
- **Test result**: max=36 km/h (matches elite human sprint)

### ✅ **Hard 36 km/h Speed Cap (v0.5.3)**

- v0.5.1 had 0.4m per-frame delta cap (prevented broadcast-cut teleports)
- v0.5.3 adds explicit `if speed_kmh <= 36.0` hard cap (belt-and-suspenders)
- Result: max across all 28 tracks in 5-min test = 35.2-36.0 km/h
- No track exceeds elite human sprint limit
- Distance slightly improved: 100-119m vs ~80m (v0.5.1) per 5-min highlight

### ✅ **Kalman Smoother Infrastructure (v0.5.3)**

- New `kalman_smoother.py` with `PlayerPositionSmoother` class
- Constant-velocity Kalman + 3-frame median pre-filter
- Conservative defaults (process_noise=0.3, measurement_noise=0.8)
- **Not wired into main pipeline**: Kalman needs continuous tracking (full 90-min match), it degrades on fragmented highlight reels (~10s per track)
- Kept as infrastructure for future full-match analysis

### ✅ **Shot Detection (v0.5.5)**

- Ball velocity tracked across 3-frame windows (frame_skip-aware)
- Two-tier detection:
  **a) Homography path**: ball speed > 8 m/s + within 20m of goal + moving toward goal → shot
  **b) Pixel fallback**: ball speed > 600 px/s + ball near image edge moving in that direction → shot
- Shooter team = the player who had possession before the shot (via `prev_possession`)
- Confidence = ball speed / 25 (pitch) or speed / 1200 (pixels), capped at 1.0
- **Test result**: 8 → 22 events in 5-min clip. ~14 new shot detections.
- All events fed to LLM for coach report context

### ✅ **Frame Skip 3 Default (v0.5.5)**

- `bridge.py` changed from `frame_skip=2` to `frame_skip=3`
- YOLO inference rate: 50 fps source → 16.7 fps effective (process every 3rd frame)
- Estimated speedup: 0.5x → ~0.75x realtime on RTX 4070
- 90-min match: ~180 min → ~120 min
- Accuracy cost minimal (BoT-SORT handles 3-frame gaps well)

### ✅ **EnhancementService Cache Crash Fixed (v0.5.5)**

- `bridge.py:202` referenced `self.enhancement_service._cache_dir` (AttributeError — didn't exist)
- Replaced with `get_paths().cache` — the correct cache path from `kawkab.core.paths`
- This was a latent bug: enabling enhancement during analysis would crash before any CV work

### ✅ **Side-of-Pitch Home/Away Validation (v0.5.4)**

- Previous heuristic: "larger color cluster = home" was still a guess
- New approach: at kickoff, home team attacks left-to-right (broadcast convention)
- Stores first pixel x-coordinate of each track in `track_registry`
- In `analyze_match`, converts to pitch-space x via homography
- Computes median x per team; lower median = home (left side)
- Auto-swaps if current assignment is reversed
- Log: "home at x=46m (left), away at x=56m (right) → already correct"
- On 1-min clip where heuristic was wrong: "→ swapped teams"
- Graceful fallback: requires ≥3 players per team with valid pitch coords
- If homography unavailable: falls back to larger-cluster heuristic

### ✅ **Cluster Color Logging (v0.5.2)**

- `tracking_metrics` now logs `home_avg_bgr` and `away_avg_bgr`
- Helps verify team assignment accuracy manually
- Example: Home=RGB(144,85,62) red-orange, Away=RGB(154,160,67) yellow-green
- User can sanity-check whether cluster_0 actually matches the expected home team

### ⚠️ **Distance Still Underestimates on Highlight Reels**

- v0.5.3 cap filters broadcast-cut teleports correctly
- 100-119m per player in 5-min highlight (vs 306m with artifact speeds, vs ~80m in v0.5.1)
- Kalman smoother added but NOT wired — highlight fragmentation makes it counterproductive
- Real fix requires continuous 90-min tracking or team-level ReID across cuts
- For highlight reels, distance is directionally correct but incomplete

### ✅ **LLM Hallucination Guardrails (v0.5.0)**

- User caught LLM saying "Tunisia dominated" on a 60s clip when Tunisia lost badly
- Added `build_match_context()` + `is_clip` flag
- System prompt now forbids claiming results on short clips
- LLM correctly opens with "This is a 300-second highlight clip, not the full match"

---

- ✅ Sequential VRAM management (YOLO → LLM)

---

## What's Still Broken / Missing

### ❌ **Bundle Size 1.75 GB**

- Lazy model loading not implemented
- All models shipped in installer
- Need 50 MB launcher + on-demand download

### ❌ **Stripe Doesn't Work in Tunisia**

- Need Lemon Squeezy or Paddle
- Not started

### ❌ **No Real Coach Validation**

- 0 amateur coaches have used this in production
- All metrics are theoretical
- CRITICAL: this is the missing validation step

### ⚠️ **CV Speed on Broadcast Footage**

- 0.5x realtime on RTX 4070 = 90 min match = 3 hours
- For amateur coaches (smaller GPUs), this could be 6-8 hours
- Need: GPU tiered model (l/n/s), maybe re-encoding step first

### ⚠️ **Distance Still Underestimates on Highlight Reels**

- v0.5.3 cap filters broadcast-cut teleports correctly
- 100-119m per 5-min highlight = 1.2-1.4 km/game equivalent (real is 9-11 km)
- **v0.6.0: Kalman smoother now wired for full matches** — should improve distance accuracy on continuous 90-min footage
- Highlight reels still use raw delta-cap approach (Kalman degrades on fragmented tracks)
- Real fix: continuous 90-min tracking or team-level ReID across cuts

### ⚠️ **Jersey OCR Unreliable**

- 8-20px numbers on amateur footage
- EasyOCR requires ~30px minimum
- Manual correction UI as fallback

### ⚠️ **BoT-SORT ReID Not Football-Tuned**

- Tracking works but identity preservation over time is weak
- Camera cuts cause ID fragmentation
- SoccerNet/tracklab integration would help

### ✅ **Home/Away Assignment Now Pitch-Based**

- v0.5.4: median pitch x per cluster determines home (left) vs away (right)
- No longer a guess — uses actual pitch geometry
- Falls back to larger-cluster heuristic only if homography unavailable
- If the broadcast shows an unusual camera angle at kickoff, swap_teams() provides manual override

## Bottom Line (v0.7.2)

**The system is now production-ready for security, advanced analytics, UI, model management, performance benchmarking, validation, and batch processing:**
- Input validation on all user-facing endpoints
- Path traversal prevention
- XSS vector removal from string inputs
- Error message sanitization (no internal paths leaked)
- **83 tests** covering security, analysis, professional services, integration, advanced metrics, model management, benchmarking, validation, and batch processing
- SQL injection resistant (parameterized queries throughout)
- **Advanced metrics auto-computed during analysis**: physical load (sprints, accelerations), pressure metrics (PPDA, counter-press), advanced events (tackles, interceptions, clearances)
- All metrics stored in database and returned to frontend
- **Professional Analytics UI**: Player Profiles, Match Comparison, Export Wizard, Quality Reports, Performance Benchmarks
- **21 services** all wired and live in the application
- **ModelManager** — lazy loading foundation for on-demand model downloads
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Per-stage timing, memory/GPU tracking, GPU tier classification, automatic settings recommendations
- **Data Accuracy Validation**: Ground truth comparison for events, possession, team assignment, speeds with precision/recall/F1 metrics
- **Batch Processing**: Overnight multi-match analysis queue with status tracking and cancellation
- **Foundation for reduced bundle size** — installer can be ~50MB launcher instead of 1.75GB monolith

**The system produces trustable spatial stats when calibrated:**
- Real meters (homography now passed to analysis pipeline)
- Real team assignment (pitch-side validated)
- Realistic max speeds (hard 36 km/h cap)
- ~3x faster than v0.4 (frame skip 1→3, better defaults)
- Shot events detected (8→22 per 5-min highlight)
- **Kalman smoother wired for full matches** — smoother trajectories, better distance accuracy
- **Match type auto-detection** — full_match vs highlight vs unknown
- **Knowledge base at 40 rules + 24 drills** — 10 new rules, 5 new drills
- EnhancementService cache crash fixed

**Critical missing validation**: 0 amateur coaches have used this in production.

**Estimated time to real v1.0**: 2-3 months focused work, with priority on:
1. Real coach validation
2. Full 90-min match analysis (Kalman ready, needs testing)
3. Bundle size optimization (PyInstaller spec + on-demand model loading)
4. Performance benchmarking and GPU tier optimization
