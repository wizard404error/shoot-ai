## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, invoke the `skill` tool with `skill: "graphify"` before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

## Tracking Accuracy Results

### A. ByteTrack association robustness (synthetic — Metrica GT with injected noise)
Tests the ByteTrack association algorithm in isolation (no YOLO, no images, no homography). Underlying positions are real match data from Metrica; noise parameters (position std, dropout rate, FP rate) are assumed, not measured from the actual YOLO pipeline. 22 players, 2000 frames.

| Label | Noise | Drop | FP | MOTA | IDF1 | IDSW |
|-------|-------|------|----|------|------|------|
| near-perfect | 0.001 | 0% | 0% | 0.9989 | 1.0000 | 50 |
| **mild (assumed noise, not measured)** | **0.005** | **10%** | **2%** | **0.8683** | **0.9406** | **864** |
| moderate-noise | 0.010 | 10% | 2% | 0.4792 | 0.8312 | 10200 |
| high-noise | 0.020 | 10% | 2% | 0.1751 | 0.5904 | 10597 |
| high-dropout | 0.005 | 20% | 2% | 0.7679 | 0.8796 | 758 |
| severe-dropout | 0.005 | 30% | 2% | 0.6691 | 0.8133 | 716 |
| combined-moderate | 0.010 | 20% | 5% | 0.4262 | 0.7536 | 7844 |
| combined-severe | 0.020 | 30% | 5% | 0.1273 | 0.4315 | 6423 |

**Key findings:**
- ByteTrack robust to 0.5% position noise + 10% dropout: MOTA=0.87, IDF1=0.94
- Breaking point at 1% position noise — IoU association fails catastrophically
- Dropout handled well (max_age=30 keeps tracks alive for occlusions)
- FP rejection excellent — ByteTrack filters most false positives via confidence/matching thresholds
- ID switches are main weakness: 864 switches at mild settings (reacquisition after dropout)

### B. End-to-end pipeline on broadcast video (pseudo-GT)
Tests the full pipeline (YOLO11m + ByteTrack + filtering + team assignment) on 15 min of broadcast footage (france_sweden_15min.mp4, 3600 detection frames). Pseudo-ground-truth = YOLO detections at conf>0.5; pipeline threshold = conf>0.4. This is NOT independent ground truth (GT and predictions come from the same model at different thresholds), so numbers should be read as "how well does tracking preserve the highest-confidence YOLO detections" rather than absolute accuracy.

| Metric | Raw detection (conf=0.4 vs conf=0.5) | Tracked (ByteTrack on conf=0.4 vs conf=0.5) |
|--------|-------|---------|
| MOTA | 0.844 | **0.538** |
| Precision | 0.865 | **0.925** |
| Recall | 1.000 | **0.586** |
| F1 | 0.928 | **0.717** |

**Key findings:**
- **Precision = 92.5%** — When the pipeline outputs a detection, it almost certainly matches a real high-confidence player detection
- **Recall = 58.6%** — But the pipeline misses ~41% of high-confidence detections, mainly from camera-cut fragmentation (frequent in broadcast footage) and ByteTrack's min_hits filter
- **MOTA = 0.538** — Positive but limited by the recall gap
- Primary recall bottleneck is broadcast camerawork (frequent cuts, close-ups, panning) not detector quality
- An independent ground truth (manual annotation or SoccerNet) is needed to validate whether the recall gap is from missed players or from the pseudo-GT including non-player detections

### C. Self-consistency (Metrica vs Metrica)
- MOTA=1.0, IDF1=1.0 — validates MOT metric computation code

- **Tracking recall**: `max_age=30→90`, `min_hits=3→1`, removed full tracker reset on camera cuts, lowered broadcast filter to `min_segments=1`/`min_pct=0.08`
- **xG training pipeline**: `scripts/train_xg_from_statsbomb.py` trains logistic regression on real StatsBomb data → `trained_xg_coefficients.json` auto-loaded by `xg_model.py` with `ENHANCED_COEFFICIENTS` fallback
- **SQLite WAL mode**: `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` + `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL` in `StorageService.initialize()`

### P2 — Professional (1/3 actionable)
- **Injury-risk model**: Replaced 8-entry heuristic with 26 evidence-based diagnosis-specific recovery ranges (Ekstrand 2011, NCAA ISP, BMJ Open SEM). Added `recovery_range_days()`, `days_until_expected_recovery()`, `injury_risk_score()` exponential curve, recurrence detection in `get_injury_stats()`, high-risk flagging in `get_squad_injury_report()`

### Other fixes from audit
- Hungarian matcher non-square crash fix, checkpoint HMAC env var, CORS env var, orphaned pipeline deletion (3 files), README numbers/version unification, tracking accuracy publication

### Still blocked (need human/external input)
- P1.6: Amateur footage evaluation (no video available)
- P2.12: Multi-camera calibration UI (architecture ready — LightGlue + segment_homography exist)
- P1.9: Event QA forcing function (exists at DB level)
- P2.11/13/15, all P3: field testing, ToS review, deployment strategy

## Professional Readiness Sprint (July 2026 — 26 items across 5 tiers)

Full 9-dimension audit completed — rating **3.5/10** → **~5/10** after Tiers 1-5 shipped.

### Tier 1 — Critical Correctness (5/5)
- **League sim median bug**: `_median_pos` was using `max()` across all sims → fixed to per-simulation tracking with correct median
- **FK enforcement**: `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` added to `StorageService.initialize()`
- **Kalman DT scaling**: Removed fixed `KALMAN_DT=1/24`, process noise now scales with actual FPS
- **Dead VAEP v2**: Removed `compute_vaep_v2()` (was identical to v1, never imported)
- **Dead carry_frames list**: Removed from `carry_xt_from_tracking` (appended but never read)

### Tier 2 — Data Trust (7/7)
- **attacking_direction**: Added param to all 6 spatial models (xT, xA, carry_xT, VAEP, defensive_actions, lineup_optimizer)
- **StatsBomb expanded**: 5 new match IDs (3753, 69301, 7189, 20388, 20464), exponential backoff on 429, coefficient validation
- **Bulk insert perf**: `save_tracking_frames_bulk` switched from per-row `execute` to `executemany`
- **Migration 023**: Missing indexes on `player_profiles(team)`, `player_profiles(global_id)`
- **SELECT * → explicit columns**: 10 read methods across storage service
- **LightGlue in CV pipeline**: Tried first per segment before persisted calibrations → PitchDetector → fallback
- **xG regression tests enabled**: `@_need_shots` skipif removed, tests always run

### Tier 3 — Pro Features (5/5)
- **MILP lineup optimizer**: ortools CP-SAT binary variable model with greedy fallback, 7 formations
- **Frame-based VAEP v2**: Uses `WeightedPitchControl` on tracking frames for event valuation
- **RK4 ball trajectory**: Real drag (Cd=0.25) + Magnus force, replacing simplified kinematic model
- **Pagination**: `limit`/`offset` on `get_match_events`, `get_match_players`, `get_player_profiles`, `get_reports`, `get_recent_benchmarks`, `get_validation_results`
- **Confidence intervals**: xG via Beta conjugate (`compute_xg_with_ci`), xT via bootstrap (`compute_action_xt_with_ci`), VAEP via block bootstrap (`compute_vaep_with_ci`)

### Tier 4 — UX Polish (5/5)
- **JS bundling**: esbuild concatenates + minifies 27 IIFE files → `dist/app.bundle.min.js` (397 KB, 46% reduction); updated `index.html` to 4 special + 1 bundle script tag
- **Undo/redo**: `app-undo.js` — `UndoManager` with 50-deep stacks, Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y bindings
- **Keyboard HUD**: `app-hud.js` — `?` key toggles overlay listing video shortcuts (Space/J/L/arrows/F), undo/redo, search; `window.KawkabShortcuts`
- **Nav consolidation**: 25 flat tabs → 6 nav groups (Dashboard/Analysis/Tactics/Coding/Squad/Admin) with group titles
- **PDF export**: `window.print()` button + `@media print` styles stripping nav/chrome, force sections visible

### Tier 5 — Infrastructure (4/4)
- **OS keychain**: `encryption.py` uses `keyring` for medical key storage (service: `kawkab-medical`), falls back to `~/.kawkab/.medical_key` file; dependency `keyring>=24.0` added
- **Backup/restore**: `StorageService.backup()` (timestamped via `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint` + `conn.backup()`), `restore()` (validate + `shutil.copy2` + re-init + migrations), `auto_backup()`
- **Migration 024**: Soft-delete columns (`is_deleted`, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by`) + indexes on `matches`, `events`, `players`, `coding_tags`; SELECT filters `WHERE (is_deleted IS NULL OR is_deleted=0)`; DELETE → `UPDATE SET is_deleted=1`; new `hard_delete_*`/`restore_*` methods
- **PostgreSQL schema alignment** (partial): pagination added to match storage_service; 15 missing tables still pending

### Result
- **38 files modified**, 2,438 insertions, 1,141 deletions
- **229+ unit tests passing** (all pre-existing failures unchanged)
- **Rating: ~5/10** after all 26 items (up from 3.5/10)
- **Next targets**: 7/10 with independent tracking GT validation + amateur footage eval
