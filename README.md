## What It Does

- **Detects & tracks players + ball** using YOLOv11/YOLO26 + BoT-SORT/Norfair with smart filters
- **YOLO-pose** for activity classification, fall detection, and player orientation
- **Team color clustering** auto-assigns home/away (no manual labels)
- **Jersey number recognition** via OCR for player identification
- **Face recognition** with InsightFace for re-identification
- **Camera calibration (homography)** — 4 pitch corners → real meters
- **Computes statistics in meters**: possession %, passes, distance, sprints, xG, xT, PPDA
- **Advanced metrics**: pressure, physical load, set-piece detection, progressive actions
- **Detects formations**: 4-3-3, 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1, 3-5-2, 5-3-2, 4-1-4-1, etc.
- **Native services**: PsychologyService, FootballRulesService, CardDetectionService, WeatherService
- **External data**: football-data.org, Bzzoiro, TheSportsDB, API-Football, EasySoccerData, StatsBomb, OpenFootball, RoboFlow Sports
- **Algorithm ports**: Kabsch (rigid alignment), Hungarian (optimal assignment), SpatialHash (O(1) neighbor lookup)
- **Bilingual reports** in English or Arabic via local LLM (Ollama)
- **Tactical pattern knowledge base** of 22+ rules and 19+ drills
- **Tactical sandbox** with matter.js for interactive formation play
- **Set-piece simulator** with MuJoCo-style physics for free-kick analysis
- **Video weather detection** with TobyBreckon-style raindrop sliding window
- **Generates 4-week training plans** with progressive overload

## ⚠️ Status

This project is under active development toward production quality.
- 100+ backend services, 4500+ unit tests, full Arabic+English UI
- Multi-phase roadmap: ✅ Phase 1 (test coverage), 🚧 Phase 2 (real-time), Phase 3 (pro analytics), Phase 4 (UX polish)

**What works:**
- ✅ Desktop app launches and shows the UI
- ✅ 50+ services initialize and operate
- ✅ YOLO + Norfair tracking on broadcast-quality footage
- ✅ YOLO26-pose for activity/fall/orientation
- ✅ Face recognition + jersey OCR
- ✅ 8 external data sources (free tiers)
- ✅ LLM generates coach reports in EN/AR
- ✅ 22+ rules + 19+ drills knowledge base
- ✅ Weather video detection (TobyBreckon-style)
- ✅ Football rules classifier (17 IFAB Laws)
- ✅ Set-piece simulator (MuJoCo + analytical fallback)
- ✅ Matter.js tactical sandbox
- ✅ 4-week training plan generator
- ✅ PyInstaller .exe builds (~1.75 GB bundle)

**Known limitations (honest):**
- ⚠️ **Tracking fragmentation**: 91 tracks for 22 players (target: <30). Real amateur footage will be worse.
- ⚠️ **No homography by default**: All spatial stats are in pixel space, not meters. Coach must calibrate first.
- ⚠️ **Jersey OCR is unreliable**: 8-20px numbers on amateur footage are very hard to read.
- ⚠️ **No validation with real coaches**: Everything is theoretical until tested in the wild.
- ⚠️ **Bundle is 1.75 GB**: Way too big for amateur adoption.

**Read [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for the full honest assessment.**

### Tracking Accuracy

Evaluated on 15min broadcast clip (`france_sweden_15min.mp4`, 3600 frames) using pseudo-ground-truth (YOLO at conf>0.5) vs pipeline (YOLO at conf>0.4 + ByteTrack):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MOTA | 0.538 |
| Precision | 92.5% |
| Recall | 58.6% |
| F1 | 0.717 |

Precision is strong (pipeline rarely hallucinates players). Recall bottleneck is broadcast camerawork (frequent cuts, close-ups), not detector quality. Amateur footage untested — see [known limitations](#%EF%B8%8F-status).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** (also works on macOS/Linux)
- **Python 3.12+** (we recommend [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- **NVIDIA GPU** with 8GB+ VRAM (RTX 3060+, RTX 4070 recommended)
- **8GB+ RAM**
- **Ollama** for local LLM: [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
- **FFmpeg** for video processing

### Installation

```powershell
# 1. Install uv (fast Python package manager)
winget install astral-sh.uv

# 2. Install Ollama
winget install Ollama.Ollama

# 3. Install FFmpeg
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg

# 4. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/jraya106/kawkab-ai.git
cd kawkab-ai

# 5. Install dependencies (includes qasync for Qt+asyncio bridge)
uv sync --extra gpu --extra audio --extra tactical --extra dev

# 6. Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch (CRITICAL for GPU)
uv pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 --reinstall

# 7. Pull a local LLM (8-9 GB)
ollama pull ministral-3:14b
# Alternatives: qwen3:14b, gemma4:12b
```

### First Run

```powershell
# Verify everything is set up
uv run python scripts/verify_system.py

# Test tracking quality (v0.12.0)
uv run python scripts/test_tracking_v2.py --video path/to/match.mp4

# Test homography integration (v0.12.0)
uv run python scripts/test_homography.py

# Launch the desktop app
uv run python -m kawkab
```

### v0.12.0 Workflow

1. Drop a match video in the app
2. Click "Analyze" — YOLO tracks 28 players (close to actual 22), K-means assigns teams by color
3. Click 4 pitch corners — calibration saved as homography matrix (in meters)
4. Re-analyze with homography — distance/formations/line height now in real meters
5. Generate coach report — LLM produces tactical narrative with evidence

### What Needs Validation ⚠️

| Feature | Status | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Tracking on amateur footage | ⚠️ "Excellent" on broadcast | Real amateur footage untested |
| Homography | ✅ Manual only | Coach must click 4 pitch corners per match |
| xG / xT | ✅ In meters | Need homography applied |

| Jersey OCR | ⚠️ Unreliable | 8-20px numbers on amateur footage |
| Reasoning | ⚠️ Untested | Rules fire on patterns we don't measure yet |
| LLM reports | ⚠️ Impressive but untested | Need real coach feedback |

### What's Not Started ❌

| Feature | Plan | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Auto keypoint detection | Homography | ❌ |
| SoccerNet/tracklab integration | Better ReID | ❌ |
| Lazy model loading | 50 MB launcher | ❌ |

## Bottom Line

This is a **viable technical architecture** with **real domain knowledge** in the knowledge base, and at v0.12.0 is on the path toward a real product. The next phases need to focus on:

1. **Validating tracking accuracy** on real amateur footage (currently tuned for broadcast)
2. **Integrating SoccerNet/tracklab** for football-tuned ReID
3. **Testing with 5+ amateur coaches** to see if reports are actually useful
4. **Reducing bundle size** via lazy model loading
5. **Building the trust layer** (model card, data card, ground truth eval, LLM groundedness)

See **[`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md)** for the full documentation map.
See **[`ITERATION_LOG.md`](ITERATION_LOG.md)** for the current cycle log and the 63-target backlog.

**The vision is sound. The execution is iterating.**
