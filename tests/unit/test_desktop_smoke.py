"""Desktop smoke: the Settings workspace must stay wired end-to-end.

The Settings contracts panel shipped fully built (bridge slot -> handler ->
JS renderer) but with NO mount point in index.html, so it silently never
rendered. These tests pin the whole chain so a rename or removal anywhere
along it fails loudly here instead of vanishing from the UI.

Note on the JS layout: the shipped UI loads dist/app.bundle.min.js (built
by scripts/bundle-js.mjs, which inlines js/app-settings.js), so the
wiring assertions check the bundle AND its sources, never a bare
<script src="js/app-settings.js"> tag.
