"""GUI e2e: one real dispatch slot per post-split handler (Phase C3).

The C1 refactor moved 46 bridge methods into MatchIntelHandler,
PhysicalHandler and DomainHandler. Unit tests verify each handler class
against stub services; this module verifies the *app-level* contract the
user actually exercises:

  real MainWindow boot -> real bridge -> real sqlite (WAL) -> dispatch
  one representative slot per new handler -> parse JSON -> assert on the
  values the UI would render.

Seeding is done through the production StorageService API (save_match /
save_events_bulk / save_acwr), so the analytics below prove the slots
read and aggregate real persisted data -- including the v0.13.2 fixes:
GPS slots must await the async storage (previously a coroutine
serialization error), and xa/pressing reports must normalize
event_type -> type (previously silent zeros on real rows).
