# Changelog

All notable changes to Kawkab AI are documented here.

## v0.13.1 (2026-09-17) — Handler split completion, cloud-server audit, hot-path benchmarks

### Changed
- **bridge_analysis.py split finished** (4981 → ~3910 lines): whiteboard (14
  methods), live-tagging (11), collaboration (12), telestration/stream capture
  (19), and cloud/OAuth/AI-v2/marketplace (29) surfaces extracted into
  `WhiteboardHandler`, `LiveHandler`, and `CloudCollabHandler`; 88 bridge.py
  delegation sites rewired with public slots unchanged. The orphaned
  `_compute_hot_zones` helper moved with its only consumers into
  `bridge_live.py` (caught by ruff F821 before it could NameError at runtime).

### Security
- **Removed `/auth/link-oauth`**: the endpoint trusted a client-asserted
  `provider_user_id`, letting any authenticated user inject an external
  identity into any account (an account-takeover primitive); it had no
  consumer anywhere. Regression test now asserts the route stays gone
  (404, not 401 — a reintroduction fails loudly).
- Cloud-server audit findings: OAuth `state` already one-time-pop and
  provider-matched; every mutating route auth-gated; WebSocket handshake
  checks token + origin + project membership before accept; SQL fully
  parameterized (the single dynamic-identifier UPDATE uses hardcoded column
  names with bound values).

### Fixed
- **Cross-file test pollution** (two independent leaks): e2e pipeline tests
  reinstated each other's CV-service stub at module teardown (later files
  imported a spec-less stub — `AttributeError: no _interpolate_skip_frames`),
  and the visualization-service tests permanently shadowed the real
  `networkx`, which made torch's dynamo importer crash with
  `ValueError: networkx.__spec__ is None` in any later real-inference test.
  Stub installs are now module-scoped fixtures that always pop.

### Added
- `scripts/bench_hot_path.py`: deterministic hot-path micro-benchmarks on
  synthetic 25fps tracking data — overlay computation 21 µs/frame, bridge
  JSON serialization 14 µs/frame, OBV schema conversion 9 µs/frame, live
  hot zones 5.5 µs/frame — plus cProfile top-N for regression tracking.

## v0.13.0 (2026-09-17) — Type-safety bug-mining + silent-failure fixes

### Fixed
- **Postgres mode initialize() regression**: `StorageService.initialize()` in
  PostgreSQL mode claimed to delegate to the adapter but never called
  `_pg.initialize()` — the pool was never created and every storage call
  silently returned empty. Now delegates and is idempotent.
- **Settings contracts panel never rendered**: the bridge slot, handler, and
  JS renderer all shipped, but `index.html` had no `#settings-contract-alerts`
  mount point. Panel now mounts and the whole chain is pinned by smoke tests.
- **DL xG model-comparison branch silently never trained**:
  `model_comparison_service` called the enhanced model's single-event
  `extract_features` where the DL model's list→matrix extractor was required.
- **SDK client paginated-endpoint bugs**: `/matches`, `/events`, `/players`
  return `{"items": [...]}` envelopes server-side; the client read bare-list
  shapes (`matches` key that never exists / returned the envelope as a list).
- **thesportsdb `_get` annotation lie** (`dict | list | None` — the API only
  ever returns JSON objects), clearing ~26 downstream type errors honestly.
- **ShotEvent distance/progression honesty**: fields are `float | None` when
  absent (no fabricated 0.0); `to_dict`/`from_dict` handle None round-trips.
- **Dead SecurityValidator fallback deleted** in six storage modules (the
  ImportError branch was unreachable and one variant never even assigned the
  fallback — a latent NameError).
- ~30 further genuine bugs mined out of the mypy backlog: None-flow guards
  (cloud server rows, storage connections), wrong element types, operator
  misuse, missing awaits/imports, multi-camera frame init regression caught
  by tests before it shipped.

### Changed
- **mypy exits 0 across 315 files** (from 878 errors at baseline): real bugs
  fixed at source, the guarded `self._conn` storage pattern converted to a
  `_require_conn()` helper, and the documented quarantine approach extended
  only for annotation-debt files (mirroring the existing precedent).
- **`AnalysisHandler` split** (5.7k lines): recruitment hub (shortlist,
  contracts, scout search, opponent DB, scouting network, Transfermarkt) and
  the Settings surface moved to `RecruitmentHandler` / `SettingsHandler`;
  bridge slots unchanged.
- **Single JS bridge resolver**: `KawkabUtils.getBridge()` in utils.js replaces
  three byte-identical `resolveBridge()` copies (onboarding, settings,
  whiteboard) and the app-3d inline probes; legacy `kawkabBridge` alias kept.
- **Contract SELECT de-duplicated**: the 13-column player-contracts query now
  lives in one constant consumed by both `StorageService` and
  `ContractTracker`.
- JS bundle rebuilt (34 sources) and frontend manifest unchanged.

### Tests
- Contract storage first-ever coverage (CRUD + expiry windows + alert levels).
- `test_storage_parity` extended: PG-mode initialize delegation + idempotency.
- New `test_desktop_smoke.py` (12 tests): Settings mount points, bundle
  contents, bridge chain per slot, shared getBridge helper, startup storage
  initialize on a real migrated DB (WAL mode), PG-mode adapter delegation.
